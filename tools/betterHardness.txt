CONFIG STRUCTURE:
  each planet type has:
    acceptable HD interval
    associated clan
    gravity range -- has
    landscape type
    allied station hull
  each clan has:
    list of hulls
    weapon prefs (bullet/energy/rocket/special)
    shield prefs
    armor prefs
    ability
  one clan is allied, system knows its name
  each system has associated clan
  each belt has associated clan
  each maze has associated clan
  special ship type -- chest?

HARDNESS ALGORITHM:
  think in terms of DamagePerSecond:
    weapon had theoretical DPS
    if gun is fixed, multiply that to .2
    multiply by x/6 where x is time enemy would stand against its own damage
    if density is higher than view dist, multiply by density factor
    if grav, multiply by grav factor
    if rocky landscape, multiply
    if asteroids, multiply
    if maze, multiply
    this way you have an avg DPS of area
    let's think that player shouldn't be in places where they can die in 10 seconds

  define global hardness multiplier
  for each system, define max & min hardness density (HD). each next system should have greater HD
  planets:
    planet HD depends on the dist from system center
    type should be selected randomly among those that accept this HD
    HD0 = HD / landscape type factor
    select gravity randomly
    HD0 /= gravity factor
    select random density multiplier
    HD0 /= density factor
    for each ship:
      sh (ship hardness) = HD0 * random factor
      then somehow decide what should a ship contain to have hardness equal to expected
  systems, belts: similar...
  loot price of each enemy should depend on HD -- if equipment is bad, add more money and vice versa
