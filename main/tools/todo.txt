===================== REST =======================================================================


BG 3.0:
  create self-repetitive nebulae, always draw 4 of them
  use another chunk layer for stars

ARCHITECTURE
  map uses hull icons (interleaving in drawIcons), world uses item icons
  ships & farShips & starPorts make mess in MapDrawer -- unify under one interface?
  warn about unused sounds
  warn about unused images
  replace AtlasRegion with SolTex, latter shouldn't extend
  get rid of Dra.getTex0
  sound volumes should be kept in one map file?

FEATURES
  implement ground tiles as polygons to avoid getting stuck inside
  star ports should be on different distances from planet center, since now they overlap
  ship traces reusable?
  update pitch to all played sounds if game time is changed?
  damaged ship hulls in place of exploded ships
  better collision prediction (multipoint)
  try using shaders

PERF
  cache cam dst to np, far sprites can check it
  use events on item addition
  use objFloatMap in soundManager
  PartMan should use pool
  string reuse
  autoboxing? (boolean is OK)

CLEANNESS
  improve teleport -- transfer body instantly via setTransform()
  get rid of Pilot.getMapHint
