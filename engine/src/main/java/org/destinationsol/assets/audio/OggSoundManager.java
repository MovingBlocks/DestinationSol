/**
 * This class represents the sound manager used in  DestinationSol. It is responsible for handling and playing all
 * sounds in the game.
 * <p>
 * This class loads the sound as required from {@link Assets}, all you need to do for your sound to be registered is to
 * place the sound in {@code .ogg} format in one of the asset-scanned directories.
 * <p>
 * You can also optionally place a text file with the same name as the ogg file and {@code .soundinfo} extension, that
 * might contain the following: {@code
 * volume=xxx
 * loopTime=xxx
 * }
 * In there, the {@code xxx} stands for a floating point number.<br>
 * {@code volume} specifies the default volume multiplier for the sound, with {@code 1.0} being the value unchanged.<br>
 * {@code loopTime} works as follows: if the loopTime is not specified or set to 0, any new request to play the sound
 * will play it again, even concurrently with itself. If the loopTime is set greater than 0, new request to play the
 * sound will be accepted only when loopTime time units has passed since the beginning of the sound's prior playback, or
 * the request is from different object.
