This is the official open source home for the arcade space shooter Destination Sol, originally started by Milosh Petrov and a small team on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/342980/) and [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/destinationsol)

After receiving highly positive reviews launching as an indie title on Steam Milosh and the remaining team members wanted to focus on different projects, having made Destination Sol primarily to try out the involved technology.

A call was put out to the player community for a new maintainer, and open source was an option praised by many and already somewhat in place on Sourceforge. The open source group MovingBlocks behind [Terasology](http://terasology.org) stepped in to offer infrastructure and maintenance.

Milosh accepted our offer and supported us in moving the game onwards to its new home here on GitHub where we'll set up to accept contributions from anybody willing to help improve Destination Sol and expand on its gameplay.

Destination Sol is now officially licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) (except soundtrack, see its section below) and available in source code form at [GitHub](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/DestinationSol).

You can download the game on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/342980/), get it in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miloshpetrov.sol2.android&hl=en), or download the [very latest version from our build server](http://jenkins.terasology.org/job/DestinationSol/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/desktop/build/distributions/DestinationSol.zip) (warning: latest build may be unstable)

Feel free to fork the project and contribute pull requests! You can visit a [Destination Sol forum](http://forum.terasology.org/forum/destination-sol.57/) on the Terasology site if you have any questions or would like to discuss the game or contributing.

Gameplay
--------

You start at the edge of a solar system as a pilot in a small ship. You are free to explore space, land on planets, fight with enemies, upgrade your ship and equipment, hire mercenaries, mine asteroids, and so on.

Enemy ships are orange icons, allies are blue. Enemies can be marked with a skull icon - beware! They are likely stronger than you. Improve your ship and equipment and fight them later!

Your ship has a certain number of hit points (your armor), which will recover if you have consumable repair kits in your inventory and stay idle for a short while. You may also have a shield that takes damage first. Each is vulnerable to different weapons, both on your ship and others.

Weapons and special abilities often need consumables to function (like Bullets or Slo Mo Charges) and take time to rearm.

You can destroy asteroids for easy money, even with the starting ship's ammo-less but weak gun.

Warnings get posted if you get close to dangerous ships or may soon collide with something on your current course. Blue dots along the edge of the screen indicate a planet is nearby.

Watch out about buying a new ship if you can only barely afford it - you might need to buy new compatible weaponry too!

Mercenaries will follow you around and should start with a compatible weapon again in v1.4.1. They'll pick up items as well and keep them, greedy little buggers! But then they drop everything again on death, so ...

Controls
--------

Note: You can select either pure keyboard, keyboard + mouse, or controller (in the settings). Exact details may change over time. Below are the default key mappings (no mouse). You can change these in-game.

*Main screen*

* [Space] - Fire main gun
* [Ctrl] - Fire secondary gun (if equipped)
* [Shift] - Use ship ability
* [Left,Right] - Turn the ship
* [Up] - Thrust. There are no brakes! You have to turn and burn to change direction or slow down
* [Tab] - Show the map
* [I] - Show inventory
* [T] - Talk (interact with a station)
* [ESC] - Menu / close screens

*With map up*

* [Up, Down] - Zoom in and out on the map

*With inventory up*

* [Left, Right] - change page
* [Up, Down] - scroll up and down
* [Space] - equip / unequip item *OR* buy / sell if talking to a station
* [D] - discard selected item


Building and running from source
--------

You only need Java installed to run Destination Sol from source. Use Java 7 or 8, the newer the better.

Run any commands in the project root directory (where you cloned / extracted the project to, using a command prompt / terminal).

* Download / clone the [source from GitHub](https://github.com/MovingBlocks/DestinationSol)
* To run from the command line: `gradlew run` (on Linux you might need to use `./gradlew run`)
* To prepare for IntelliJ run: `gradlew idea` then load the generated project via `DestinationSol.ipr`
* To create a game package for distribution (Windows, Linux, Mac): `gradlew distZip`

For Android a little extra setup is needed

* Add in the Android code: `gradlew fetchAndroid` and then rerun Gradle once - for instance `gradlew idea` again
* Install the official Android SDK from Google - exact version info is still TODO
* Make a local.properties in the project root with the path to your SDK. Example: sdk.dir=C\:/Dev/Android/SDK
* To prepare in IntelliJ go to Project Structure and under Modules click the android "folder" icon and set the SDK
* In the same window go to Artifacts and add a new Android Application, created from the android module
* Supply a code signing keystore or supply other debug configuration
* To run in IntelliJ make sure you have an Android emulator (or USB connection) working then create a run configuration
* We use `gradlew assembleRelease` to build the APK for Google Play (with the right keystore etc)

You can also run the Android version via Gradle: `gradlew android` - but need your device setup. TODO more instructions.

GWT / HTML

LibGDX supports an HTML based facade based on the Google Web Toolkit. Its use isn't all the way implemented yet.

* Add in the code like with Android: `gradlew fetchGwt` then rerun Gradle
